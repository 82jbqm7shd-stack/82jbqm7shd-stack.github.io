<section id="overview">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Hopking’s maritime career developed from expedition and adventure-based sailing in the early 1990s into long-term command appointments
    and project leadership roles within the superyacht industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    His early professional experience involved offshore sailing and expedition support, including work associated with small-craft operations
    in remote and high-latitude environments. From the early 2000s onward, his career increasingly focused on the command, governance,
    and operational management of large private yachts, alongside participation in new-build and commissioning projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    In later roles, his responsibilities extended beyond navigation and seamanship to include regulatory compliance, document control,
    risk management, and stakeholder liaison, reflecting the growing emphasis on governance and assurance within modern superyacht operations.
  </p>

<section id="maritime-career">
  <h2>Maritime career</h2>

  <h3>Early career and expedition work</h3>
  <p>
    Hopking’s maritime career began in the early 1990s in Scotland, where he worked at the John Ridgway Adventure School in Sutherland.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
    His work there formed the basis of <em>Exposure</em>, a 1993 episode of Channel 4’s <em>Cutting Edge</em> documentary strand,
    which documented aspects of adventure training and expedition preparation.<sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    During the same period, while working with the Ridgway family, Hopking took part in a sea kayaking expedition around Cape Horn.
    This expedition was a family-led venture rather than an Adventure School programme and was documented in contemporaneous press coverage,
    a 1993 ITV film, and in Rebecca Ridgway’s book <em>Something Amazing</em>, in which Hopking appears.<sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Earlier in the decade, he also served as crew aboard the yacht <em>English Rose VI</em>, a vessel previously known as <em>Debenhams</em>
    during its participation in the 1977–78 Whitbread Round the World Race.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <h3>Environmental and polar sailing</h3>
  <p>
    In 1999, Hopking became captain of the expedition yacht <em>2041</em>, which had been acquired by environmentalist Robert Swan
    for an Antarctic Treaty awareness programme.<sup><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>
    He skippered the vessel from the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Peninsula and led operations during two Antarctic seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    The voyage and associated expeditions were later documented in the book <em>2041: Voyage South</em>,
    which describes the objectives and experiences of the programme.<sup><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <h3>Superyacht command</h3>
  <p>
    In the early 2000s, Hopking moved into the superyacht sector, taking on command appointments aboard large private motor yachts.
    Between 2011 and 2016, he commanded the 78-metre motor yacht <em>Hampshire II</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this period, his work extended beyond command at sea to include document control, regulatory compliance,
    and governance practices. His contributions in these areas were recognised within the industry,
    and he participated in published discussions on regulatory pressures and cultural change within the superyacht sector.<sup><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-14">[14]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-15">[15]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    A 1998 profile in <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> had earlier examined his career and approach to financial planning
    during his work with The Challenge Business, organisers of the Global Challenge ocean races.<sup><a href="#ref-10">[10]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <h3>New-build and project leadership</h3>
  <p>
    Hopking subsequently served as project manager and build captain for the 74-metre Feadship explorer yacht <em>Sherpa</em>,
    overseeing construction at Feadship’s Royal Van Lent shipyard. His role encompassed design development,
    stakeholder coordination, and the transition from build to operational service.
  </p>
  <p>
    The build and launch of <em>Sherpa</em> were covered in specialist yachting publications and formed the subject of a documentary
    in which Hopking appeared.<sup><a href="#ref-16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-18">[18]</a></sup>
  </p>
</section>

<section id="barony">
  <h2>Barony of Balvill</h2>
  <p>
    Hopking holds the Scottish feudal barony of Balvill.<sup><a href="#ref-19">[19]</a></sup>
    The dignity was created by Crown charter in 1630 in favour of Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne
    (later 8th Earl and 1st Marquess of Argyll), and remained associated with the Campbells of Argyll for several centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, Scottish feudal baronies continued as incorporeal heritable property.
    Hopking became the holder of the barony by assignation in 2025.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="heraldry">
  <h2>Heraldry and tartan</h2>
  <p>
    Hopking was granted arms by the Court of the Lord Lyon in 2018, which are recorded in the
    <em>Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland</em>.<sup><a href="#ref-20">[20]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-21">[21]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    He also holds a personal tartan registered in the Scottish Register of Tartans
    under the name “Hopking, M &amp; Family (Personal)”.<sup><a href="#ref-22">[22]</a></sup>
  </p>
</section>

<section id="personal-life">
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>
    Hopking lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. He has two children.
  </p>
  <p>
    He maintains an active interest in Scottish heraldry and genealogy and is a Fellow of the
    Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref-23">[23]</a></sup>
